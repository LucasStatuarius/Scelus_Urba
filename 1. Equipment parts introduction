Here I will be writing about clothings, weapons and accessories.

1. Clothings;
   In the game there will be 4 clothing types one can equip and no more:
   - Upper clothing (will be the richest in armor stats count)
   - Lower clothing (will be the second in terms of armoring)
   - Head gear (will be 3rd...)
   - Foot gear (will be 4th...)

2. Accessories;
   In the game there will be 2 accessories slots one can possibly have and one
   can have various types of accessories that influence its respective areas
   which those are responsible for. For instance:
   - Finger ring
   - Ear ring
   - Pendant
   - Watch

3. Weaponry;
   There will be several weapon types which would have its specific properties:
   - Swords (deal base damage + 2x int. stat's count * ADEI + 3x veh. stat's count * ADEI)
            (the best for ones who utilize highly defensive stance) (deals good damage considering twinned
             damage output (physical and kinetic) which can swiftly utilize lacks in enemy's resistances)

   - Drones (deal base damage + 3x int. stat's count * ADEI + 2x swi. stat's count * ADEI)
            (the best for ones who prefer to control the drone and shoot lasers on the enemy while running away)
            (it's a smart tactic against barbarians who only focus on physical prowess)

   - Guns (deal base damage + 2x int. stat's count * ADEI 

   - Attack gloves (deal base damage + pure physical damage 4 times the vehemence stat's count
                    multiplied by the attribute damage empowerment index (ADEI) )
                   (the best for brutal barbaric boxers) (the worst if one has high physical resistance)
