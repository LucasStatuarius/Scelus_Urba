Here I will be writing about clothings, weapons and accessories.

1. Clothings;
   In the game there will be 4 clothing types one can equip and no more:
   - Upper clothing (will be the richest in armor stats count) (this equipment part can also have resistances)
   - Lower clothing (will be the second in terms of armoring) (resistances are here too)
   - Head gear (will be 3rd...) (resistances are here also)
   - Foot gear (will be 4th...) (resistances are also here)

2. Accessories;
   In the game there will be 2 accessories slots one can possibly have and one
   can have various types of accessories that influence its respective areas
   which those are responsible for. For instance:
   - Finger ring - improves mainly vehemence through it's additional pure number
   - Ear ring - improves mainly swiftness through it's additional pure number
   - Pendant - improves mainly vitality through it's additional pure number
   - Watch - improves mainly intellect through it's additional pure number

3. Weaponry;
   There will be several weapon types which would have its specific properties:
   - Swords (deal base damage + 2x int. stat's count * ADEI + 3x veh. stat's count * ADEI)

   - Drones (deal base damage + 3x int. stat's count * ADEI + 2x swi. stat's count * ADEI)

   - Guns (deal base damage + 3x swi. stat's count * ADEI + 2x veh. stat's count * ADEI)

   - Attack gloves (deal base damage + pure physical damage 4 times the vehemence stat's count
                    multiplied by the "attribute damage empowerment index" (ADEI) )

   - Plasma riffles (deal base damage + pure energy damage 4 times the int. * ADEI)

   - Greade launcher (deal base damage + pure kinetic damage 4 times the swi. * ADEI)

4. For every Equipment part there are also tiers that can influence the quality of all of 
   described above stuff's properties. I will bring the description:
   - Trash grade: has the lowest properties and basically has one weak stat
   - Common grade: has still one property, however it's better than trash grade
   - Rare grade: has two properties and better stats than common grade
   - Unique grade: has two properties and you can install additional random stat
   - Incredible: has two properties and you can intall two additional random stats

   I have to underline that random doesn't mean every stat possible in game.
   Additional stats just make weapons, clothings and accessories have its realistic
   extensions of the qualities which make every part of the equipment integral,
   independent, and logical. 
   How can you have health or vitality stat in your weapon which is not 
   close to your own vital organs and doesn't have any healing properties?
   How could you have critical rate and severity from clothes or watch where it is
   solely dependent on your abilities to catch the moment of an opportunity to wound
   heavily your enemy and then use that moment for your best advantage?

   That all explains why I will add also Training Sessions which improve one's health,
   endurance, attributes, critical rate/sev and block rate/sev.

5. Leveling equipment up:
   When I was playing the ALC I was very upset about leaving my well-made equipment that
   can't be developed further than the limit of 10 levels upgrade after I maxed it's level
   and my current at that time level was far beyond that level.

   The equipment levels are limited to the level stages which are absurd for many players
   without any way (even risky one) to breakthough past that limit making them grind all
   over again to get good or even better equipment stats than before changing the set.

   I have envisioned a better way than in CCO and ALC to manage and develop equipment
   parts which is founded on 2 pillars:
   - The equipment drop from enemy buildings and complexes of facilities are gradual
     meaning that they drop in a scope of 5 levels below the raided area lvl and 2 
     levels above the raided area lvl drop from defeated enemies or chests loots.
   - The equipment after 6 optimizations (that's the term for lvling up) can't be 
     developed further. That's why it needs to be rebuilt by the smith for a high price.
     The more times the equipment will be successfuly rebuilt the lower will be
     the success rate and the higher will be the destruction rate if failed.
     Also the rebuilding will take some time so you need to wait minutes or even
     hours to complete it. It's better to have a back-up equipment at that time.

6. By the way there is no need to do "calibration" of the equipment like in ALC
   because it's riddiculously dependent on luck to get a way more powerful
   equipment than other unlucky do (skills and wisdom over luck). I don't want to 
   add another trouble for my programmer friend who would code it all in my stead.
