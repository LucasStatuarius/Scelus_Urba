Here I will be writing about clothings, weapons and accessories.

1. Clothings;
   In the game there will be 4 clothing types one can equip and no more:
   - Upper clothing (will be the richest in armor stats count)
   - Lower clothing (will be the second in terms of armoring)
   - Head gear (will be 3rd...)
   - Foot gear (will be 4th...)

2. Accessories;
   In the game there will be 2 accessories slots one can possibly have and one
   can have various types of accessories that influence its respective areas
   which those are responsible for.
