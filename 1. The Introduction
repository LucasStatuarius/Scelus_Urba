"Scelus Urba" is a game which is created for the players who like the text-based, MMO, 
rich in lore, simple to learn and challenging to master games.

The game's action is set in the city called "Strati via igni" and this world's year is 2074 (50 years after our times).
This city as it might be shown in other futuristic games is full of cybernetics, modern mafias called "enterprises",
"the government", "hordes" and above them all "The New Order Logde" which is the freemasonry foundation whose primal
goal is to advance the humankind via technological advancement. Although they declare that they want the good of the
humankind their actions result in making people poorer and less happier. 

You will see the seemingly bottomless darkness this city emanates wherever you go and whoever you meet. 
Corpses of starved people lie on the slum streets, woman and men because of the hopeless situation sell themselves as a 
corporative slave who works to death without time to take care to raise the children. 
Schools don't teach you as a kid anything at all leaving you with wasted years. In the city's corners girls
are being brutally raped and killed if bandits are "bored", cunning girls bring naive boys with luring seduction to make
another drama for "lawful" compensations via court making them ultimately suicidal. Enterprises are desperate to work their 
workers to death just to survive another month. the government puts more and more laws to confuse the intellectuals 
for more benefits to TNO Lodge and its subjects working in a scope from the baby care business to the most brutal jobs 
of mutilating people, selling people, slaughtering "unwanted" ones, enslaving the very minds of masses through everything possible,
owning and running mafia clubs, executing the debts of unrepayable debtors by not only claiming the property but also
by forcing slavery upon them. The list of crimes and atrocities are too long to be mentioned.

It's estimated that this city's population is around 33 000 000 people according to the government's registration of citizens.
That's most likely false, since people are lost, killed and kidnapped so that the data might have long-dead people considered
as yet alive with the addition of the lack of forces to recruit for the establishment in order to count the slum district's
population which makes near 27% of the city's territory. Other than that the establishment enforces to strictly monitor the 
working class population which lives in the factory district's rented low-end apartments and that zone is covering around 43%
of the city's area, The market district is the pearl of the city for glamorous buildings,
