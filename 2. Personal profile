Personal Profile is a panel where you can view your:
overall statistics, equipment, weaponry, skills, jobs proficiency, meaningfullness bonuses,
affiliations and status that's shown for other players to see.

1. Main profile page:
   That's the first page of the curriculum for the player's info.
   It contains his avatar looks, activity status, peaceful/hostile public status, player's role
   Date of joining the game, class of the player, affiliation, membership in an associaship
   And raw stats summary.

   - The placement for the avatar's picture: top left corner of the MP page;
   - The profile description's placement: next to the avatar's picture matching its height,
     Description's contents from top to bottom: Player's name, Activity status, Date of joining
                                                Class, Role, affiliation, Public Status
   - The membership for the association: the all wide window, separating the player's description and avatar from stats window
   - Stats window summary: it's below everything else on that page and shows everything in a specific order:
     * defensive stats:
       - health (the player's measure count for body's survival capabilities) (it's based on the player's level and liveliness attribute count)

       - endurance (the player's measure count for body's damage absorbtion capabilities) (it's solely based on liveliness attribute count)

       - armor (the player's measure for equipment's capability count to absorb damage taken until the enemy can inflict damage to your body)
               (armor is solely dependent on the equipment's quality one wears) (endurance stat can't reduce the damage taken by armor stat)

       - physical resistance (the player's capability to absorb the damage made by meele weapons lessening the damage taken for both
                              the body and armor one wears) (it's dependent on the vehemence attribute stat count and clothings one wears)
       - kinetic resistance (for firearms damage) (it's dependent on swiftness attribute stat count and clothings one wears)
       - energy resistance (for laser/electric damage) (it's dependent on attentiveness attribute stat count and clothes one wears)

       - evasion rate (the player's capability per chance to not take any damage at all) (it's set by 5% for every player at the beginning)

       - block rate (the player's capability per chance to take lesser damage than if exposed) (it's dependent on the combat training sessions)

       - block severity (the player's capability of blocking damage taken in a certain percentage scope when in effect) 
                        (it's dependent on the combat training sessions) (after reducing the damage with block severity the damage will be absorbed
                         by its respective resistance (and by endurance if equipment isn't covering the damage anymore but the body takes it)
                         and the rest of the damage will be dealt to either armor or health as a result) (combat training sessions = CTS)

     * offensive stats:
       - base damage (the player's measure of dealing universal damage on any opponent out of attribute damage) (dependent on the player's level)

       - physical damage /(the player's attribute damage count added when using a specific type of weapon)                                  /
       - kinetic damage /(it's dependent by each respective attribute stat count and the quality of the weapon one uses)                   /
       - energy damage /(one of the damage types combined with base damage make specified damage that will be delivered against the enemy)/

       - critical rate (the player's capability per chance to deliver base or specified damage with higher power) (it's dependent on CTS)
       - critical severity (the player's capability of dealing additional damage within a certain percentage scope when in effect)
                           (it is dependent on the combat training sessions)

     * attribute stats:
       - liveliness: every single point increases health by 50 and endurance by 2
       - vehemence: every single point inreases physical damage by 10 and physical resistance by 5
       - swiftness: every single point increases kinetic damage by 10 and kinetic resistance by 5
       - attentiveness: every single point increases energy damage by 10 and energy resistance by 5

     * base stats explanation: 
       - base damage: every single level of the character makes the player deal 10 more damage (lvl 1: 10, lvl 4: 40 and so on)
       - health: every single level of the character makes the player have 100 more health (lvl 1: 100, lvl 3: 300 and so on)
       
2. Equipment page:
   The page where one can see the defensive capabilities of the certain player through what one wears
   The slots of the equipment are described like this:
   - one can wear clothings each at one time (upper clothing, lower clothing, head gear and foot gear) and those 
     will be possessing armor and its specific resistances that will add a diversity for getting loot and crafting.
   - one can wear accessories which have its own qualities if you are wearing (2-4 slots would be fine and I have no particular idea yet).
   - for cyberpunks they can also be equipped with installed implants that enhance the abilities for the player of that class
     implants possess offensive capabilities however those are placed there because they are intalled in the cyberpunk's body
     and it's directly connected to it.

3. Weapons page:
   The page where one can see the offensive capabilities of the certain player through weapons one is equipped with.
