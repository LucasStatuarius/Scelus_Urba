The AFK mode is the gameplay mode for passive income and for gaining resources.
there are two types of AFK mode labors:
- Personal AFK labor
- Delegated AFK labor (I will cover it in another chapter)

Personal AFK labor is the mode which is designed for player to reduce the time of active gameplay
in exchange for passive income of resources, equipment and bronze coins as a payment which also 
over time will develop work skills of an individual to be more diligent and dedicated to it.

First of all I will divide the player's proficiency for his/her work efficiency:
1. Universal job prowess - which develops faster time to finish tasks and higher quantity of tasks
   one can take in one run.
2. Specialized job prowess - which develops more efficient work skills on one job one already took
   to do. In effect the skillfulness results in higher income and rewards.

Next thing I have to add is that prowess on both fields work in a way that one gains exp and if
exp's count had passed the required count to lvl up then one will get its respective points one can only
use them to upgrade within the area of possible improvements one considers as right.

For example one had already finished the bodyguarding task which makes his job proficiency level go up.
Now he has gotten in result another point of vehemence stat and vehemence-oriented job proficiency
where one can select between raising bronze coins income and raising the gain rate of resources
