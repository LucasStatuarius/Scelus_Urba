Believers are the most kind, gracious, willing to sacrifice their life for others and to martyrdom
but they don't waste their life. They are in contradiction of other beliefs not trusting themselves as individuals since they
are yet full of faulty ideas and views, that's why they observe the surroundings and through reason they follow the way to grow
in virtues. Their teachings might look complicated and their low numbers don't really stand the threat as it is for the TNO Lodge
however it's unbearable for them to have such an adversary because they speak the truth and the truth frees those who were slaves
for them, even the high-ranked members of TNO Lodge convert to catholicism shaking the entire structure made through hard work of
the generations ever since the establishment of masonry around 350 years ago. Other "religions" follow their instruction and work
with them along with christian denominations like neoprotestantists and neorthoxists. That's not the case for them because they
fight without fear, as if someone far superior who exceeds the imagination, power, time, space, death and sin. Their confidence
and resilience even in the face of death is magnetizing. One might wonder: why are they like this? They are nuts!! Any other
argument goes along this way but that's the true essence of christianity which is in catholics. This essence bore the happiness
of poor people who don't have anything to eat and made the rich ones find peace of their mind, as you explore the historical
proofs scattered around the city, you see that catholics back then were bringing the real advancement of the humankind.
They didn't just invent new technologies but they focused on utilizing things in the best way possible making the world not free
from anything that bothers people but thankful for having things which make life easier thanking for the Lord's mercy. They
don't have any willingness to be independent and to stand in power or to deliver violence upon anyone since they have humility.
